Eclipse is an open source IDE and supports a variety of programming languages including plugin functionality. Eclipse supports the standard GNU environment for compiling, building and debugging applications. The CDT is a plugin which enables development of C/C++ applications in eclipse. It enables functionality including code browsing, syntax highlighting and code completion. We verify a 50X improvement in LOC automation for Fake class .cpp / .h and class test .cpp code generation.}, publisher={figshare}, author={D'Souza, Shaun and Jami, Mohan}, year={2015},
